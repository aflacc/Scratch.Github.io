<div class="text">Hello! I am <a class="italic">The_Imagineer_</a> and this is my website! I discovered <a class="bold">Scratch</a> in 2015 and in 2016, I created my first account, <a class="italic">EpicSnuggles15</a> (I really liked and still do like cats). Around September of 2018, I created the account you know me as today, <a class="italic">The_Imagineer_</a>. I created the account as an account for serious games and projects and I wanted a fresh start because I had a lot of cringy stuff on my old account. My first project I shared to the public was <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/255195877/"> Gravity</a>. My idea of keeping the account serious would not last because I am incapable of keeping anything serious for too long.</div>
